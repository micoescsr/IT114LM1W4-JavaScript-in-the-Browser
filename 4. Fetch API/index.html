        // Checkpoint 4.1 What are HTTP requests and reponses? What are the various HTTP verbs and what do they do?
        // Answer: HTTP requests is a message sent by the client to the server, like a communication on the web. The client sends a request to a server,
        //         then the server responds with the requested action/information. There are various HTTP verbs that are commonly used, and these are GET,
        //         POST, PUT, DELETE. The GET verb retrieves the information from a server, and it is mainly used for most web page visits. The POST verb
        //         sends the data to the server to create or update an information or resource, and it is mainly used for submitting forms and uploading files.
        //         The PUT verb updates an existing resource on the server. Lastly, the DELETE verb deletes a resource from the server.

        // Todo 4.1 Fetch the list of users. Outout the first and second page of users.

        console.log("Page 1 Users:", userData.data);

        const userResp2 = await fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2");
        const userData2 = await userResp2.json();
        console.log("Page 2 Users:", userData2.data);

        // Todo 4.2 Fetch the information about a single user. Display their information

        const user1 = 1;
        const snglUser = await fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users/2");
        const snglUserData = await snglUser.json();
        console.log("Single User:", snglUserData.data);

            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },

            }),
          }
        );

        const updatedUserDt = await updateUser.json();
        console.log("Updated User:", updatedUserDt);

        // Todo 4.5 Delete the user that you have created

        const deleteUser = await fetch(
          `https://reqres.in/api/users/${createdUser.id}`,
          { method: "DELETE" }
        );

          console.log("User Deleted Successfully");

        // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
        // Answer: Then-catch, callbacks, and await-try-catch are mechanisms in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Callbacks represent
        //         a functional programming style, passing functions as arguments to handle asynchronous completion. Also, callbacks are preffered for
        //         basic asynchronous tasks with straightforward error handling. The then-catch utilizes the promise object and its chaining capabilities,
        //         offering a more object-oriented approach. Then-catch is preferably used when handling asynchronous operations with Promises, and chaining
        //         multiple asynchronous operations. Lastly, the await-try-catch is used in JavaScript when working with asynchronous functions that return
        //         Promises, and it involves the use of the await keyword within an async function along with a try-catch block. This is used when handling
        //         multiple asynchronous operations (complex operations) in a more synchronous and readable manner.
